# Dart Reduce() Error on Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with an empty list.  The `reduce()` method requires at least one element in the list to operate correctly. Attempting to use it on an empty list will result in an error.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code exhibiting this error. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to handle this scenario gracefully.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and handling edge cases when working with list operations in Dart.
